# Random Nihongo

This is the repo for the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) deck I am using for Japanese learning.
Please note that words are added to the deck *randomly* as I encouter them in real life usage.

This repo uses [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki),
a plugin for Anki to parse JSON files.
