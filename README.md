# Random Nihongo

This is the repo for the [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) deck I am using for Japanese learning.
Please note that words are added to the deck *randomly* as I encouter them in real life usage.

It is not intended for beginners and I cannot assure its accuracy. Use at your own risk.
